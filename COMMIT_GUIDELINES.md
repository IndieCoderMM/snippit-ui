# Commit Guidelines

When making commits to this project, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Keep it concise**: Aim to make small and focused commits that address a single logical change. 
2. **Use present tense**: Write commit messages starting with a verb in the *Present tense*, such as `Add`, `Fix` or `Update`.
3. **Provide a summary**: Start the commit message with a brief summary (subject) that describes the main change introduced. Limit the subject line to 50 characters or less.
4. **Add more details if needed**: If additional explanation is necessary, provide a more detailed description after the subject line.
5. **Proofread your commit messages**: Before finalizing the commit, take a moment to review your message for clarity, grammar and spelling mistakes.
